  <!-- SOCIALIZATION -->
  <section id="socialization" class="socialization">
    <h2>Socialization</h2>
      <p>On the first day of Grade 7, I instantly became friends with <mark>Xyrus</mark> because he was my seatmate, that makes him my very first friend in LPSci. We were talking about cars and sports and that's how we became friends. Behind us sat <mark>Lucas</mark>, with me being me I talked to him like I already knew him. We became friends after we joked around about elementary school and girls. He is my very first bestfriend in LPSci, all the way until now.
    Also conveniently seated right behind us was <mark>Enzo</mark>, he was really noisy and I was asking him to keep quiet. Somehow we ended up having a conversation about cars, so now there were 4 of us talking and laughing at the back of 7-Benevolence. Around 3 days later when we had proper seating arrangements, I met <mark>Chaello</mark>. We became friends quickly and after 1 skit presentation for MAPEH, she became my "daughter" and around maybe a year later we
    became bestfriends along with <mark>Sefie</mark>. I don't even know how I got close with Sefie, it just happened so quickly. A year and a half ago we started talking because of Chaello. I never talked to her in Grade 7 because she had a crush on me and now suddenly we were close and bestfriends. And that made BenjaFieChae (our trio). When I got put into Connection there were only two of us from Benevolence, me and Chiara. I didn't really know what 
    I was gonna do to make friends but when I went to Brigada I instantly made a friend with 3 people. I didn't who they were before that but you know, boys being boys, we became friends. They were Kiel Reyes, Edward Mendez, and <mark>Renz Amadure</mark>. Now that Kiel and Edward got separated from us, me and Renz got closer because there isn't anyone else who's as kulit as us. Back in Grade 8 as well, I heard there was a transferee. I told Lucas "We have 
    to make this guy our friend" and he reluctantly agreed because he's an introvert. I went to Courage and started talking to him, and from that day forward we would always greet eachother. His name is <mark>Gelo</mark>, and now that we're classmates we got even closer and even made our own trio: Me, Renz, and Him. Also in Grade 8, I met <mark>Zoe</mark> and we instantly became friends, which is weird because if you know Zoe then you would know she rarely becomes friends 
    with people. We bonded over wealth, money, and politics, as well as hatred for certain things. She then introduced me to <mark>Lorraine</mark>, who in turn introduced me to <mark>Romina</mark>. Back in Grade 8 they were my friend group aside from Kiel, Edward, and Renz. In fact, I was with Zoe, Romina, Lorraine, and Chiara for most of my Grade 8 time, and there were multiple instances when people thought I had a crush on either one of them.</p>

  <!-- FAMILY -->
  <section id="family" class="family">
    <h2>My Family</h2>
    <p>I was born in a middle class household, which I am very grateful for. I'm also grateful to the fact my family is complete, maybe even more than complete. When I was growing up I had a grandmother named Nenita N. Antolin, I used to call her Mamu, and she would constantly spoil me with gifts, food, and money. However unfortunately we lost her last May 2020. 
      My grandfather, Benjamin J. Antolin, would also always spoil me but not as much as my grandma. I call my grandpa, Papap, for reasons I don't know until now. I have two titas, Tita Janeth and Tita Roan. Both of them also spoiled me to the max, especially Tita Janeth who would always give me money every 2 weeks until now and would always buy me food and gifts randomly. I also have an older sister, Vivien, who is 10 years older than me and we have a normal sibling 
      relationship with occassional quarrels, but even she would buy me random stuff and give me money. My dad, Vincent N. Antolin, also loves spoiling me with what I want although it is in moderation. He bought maybe 80% of what I have right now. He bought me numerous phones over the years, numerous tablets, laptops, and PCs. He especially loved buying gadgets because he's a computer engineer and loves fiddling with codes and stuff. My mother, Roselyn is my the most supportive
       person in my life. She always supports me in the competitions I join, the things I do, the sports I play. Although she doesn't spoil me meterially, she does spoil me with emotions.</p>

      <h4>Buwan ng Wika & ASEAN Month</h4>
      <div class="reflection">
        <p>
          During Buwan ng Wika and ASEAN Month, I realized how unity and culture can thrive when people come together to celebrate our identity. I learned that honoring language isn’t just about speaking it — it’s about understanding the stories and values it carries. I participated by creating visuals and joining performances that promoted our national pride. If I were to teach this, I’d say it’s a reminder that every dialect and culture deserves recognition. Events like this remind us that we share one soul as a nation, no matter how diverse we are.

      <div class="reflection">
        <p>
          The Science Fair taught me that curiosity and teamwork can lead to discoveries far greater than expected. I learned how to turn questions into experiments and ideas into results. I participated by helping gather data and presenting with my group. If I were to teach this, I’d emphasize how curiosity is the root of learning. This event showed me that science isn’t just about answers — it’s about the thrill of finding them together.

        <p>
          Intramurals reminded me of the power of unity, sportsmanship, and fun. I learned that victory isn’t everything — what matters most is how we support and respect one another. I joined in the games and cheered with my classmates, feeling the true spirit of belonging. If I taught this, I’d say that teamwork builds character more than competition does. This event is important because it strengthens our bonds as students and friends.

      <div class="reflection">
        <p>
          Teacher’s Day taught me the value of gratitude and appreciation. I helped prepare gifts and took part in performances to honor our mentors. I realized how much effort teachers put into shaping our lives, and it made me more thankful for their dedication. If I taught this to others, I’d say that respect and kindness go a long way. This event matters because it reminds us that no knowledge exists without someone willing to teach.

          During the Senior High School Intramurals, I learned how different grade levels can unite through excitement and shared passion. I helped in organizing and cheering for our house, realizing how collaboration goes beyond age and section. If I taught this, I’d say it’s proof that spirit and teamwork are universal. This event showed me how pride and friendship can blend into something truly inspiring.

          The Division Schools Press Conference showed me the beauty of words and the power of storytelling. I learned that journalism isn’t just about writing — it’s about expressing truth and emotion through language. I joined the editing and layout process and saw how teamwork brought our stories to life. If I were to teach this, I’d say that every voice matters. This event is important because it gives young writers a place to be heard and inspires us to speak with purpose.

    <p>Explore the lessons that helped me understand the world of economics — how supply, demand, and choices shape our daily lives.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="ap-gallery">

    <!-- LESSON 1 -->
    <div class="ap-card" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">
      <h4>Lesson 1: Demand</h4>
      <div class="ap-images">
        <img src="demandcurve.jpg" alt="Lesson 1 Image 1">
        <img src="demandpalengke.jpg" alt="Lesson 1 Image 2">
      </div>
      <div class="ap-expand">
        <p><strong>Short Discussion:</strong> Ang demand ay tumutukoy sa dami ng produkto o serbisyo na nais at kayang bilhin ng mga konsyumer sa isang takdang panahon at presyo. Kasama rito ang dalawang mahalagang elemento: ang kagustuhan (wants) at kakayahan (ability) ng mamimili. Makikita rin dito ang ugnayan ng presyo at dami, kapag mas mababa ang presyo, kadalasang mas mataas ang quantity demanded, at kapag tumaas ang presyo, bumababa ang demand (ceteris paribus). Maraming salik ang nakakaapekto sa demand gaya ng kita ng mamimili, panlasa, presyo ng mga kahalili, inaasahang pagbabago sa presyo, at populasyon.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong> Natutunan ko na ang bawat desisyon ko sa pamimili tulad ng pagpili ng murang produkto o paghihintay ng sale at discount ay may epekto sa ekonomiya. Napagtanto ko na kung marami kaming kailangang bilhin sa bahay, dapat kaming magplano at huwag basta-basta bumili. Kung ipapaliwanag ko ito sa kaklase, sasabihin ko na ang demand ay parang listahan ng gusto mong bilhin batay sa pera mo at kung gaano kataas ang presyo. Mahalaga ito dahil kapag naiintindihan natin ang demand, mas magiging matalino tayo sa paggastos at makakatulong sa sarili natin at pamilya.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- LESSON 2 -->
    <div class="ap-card" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">
      <h4>Lesson 2: Supply</h4>
      <div class="ap-images">
        <img src="ricesupply.jpg" alt="Lesson 2 Image 1">
        <img src="supplycurve.jpg" alt="Lesson 2 Image 2">
      </div>
      <div class="ap-expand">
        <p><strong>Short Discussion:</strong> Ang supply naman ay tumutukoy sa dami ng produkto o serbisyo na handang ipagbili o iprovide ng mga prodyuser sa iba't ibang presyo at takdang panahon. Karaniwang mas mataas ang supply kapag tumataas ang presyo dahil hinihikayat nito ang mga prodyuser na gumawa ng mas marami, at bumababa ito kapag mababa ang presyo o mataas ang gastos sa produksyon. Kasama sa salik na nakaaapekto sa supply ang teknolohiya, presyo ng input, bilang ng prodyuser, inaasahang pagbabago sa presyo, at iba pa.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong> Sa pag-aaral ng supply, natutunan ko na hindi lang sa mamimili umiikot ang ekonomiya, may malaking bahagi rin ang mga nagbebenta at ang kanilang kakayahang magbenta. Napagtanto ko na kapag maraming supply, mas may pagpipilian ang mamimili at mas bumababa ang presyo. Kung ipapaliwanag ko ito sa kaklase, sasabihin ko na para kang nagbebenta ng mga gawa mo, kapag mabenta ang gawa mo sa mas mataas na presyo, gagawa ka pa dahil sulit.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- LESSON 3 -->
    <div class="ap-card" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">
      <h4>Lesson 3: Elasticity</h4>
      <div class="ap-images">
        <img src="elasticity1.jpg" alt="Lesson 3 Image 1">
        <img src="elasticity2.png" alt="Lesson 3 Image 2">
      </div>
      <div class="ap-expand">
        <p><strong>Short Discussion:</strong> Ang elasticity o elastisidad ay tumutukoy sa antas ng pagtugon ng demand o suplay sa pagbabago ng presyo. Kapag elastik, malaki ang pagbabago ng demand kapag tumaas o bumaba ang presyo; kapag di-elastik, maliit lamang ang pagbabago dahil ito ay pangunahing pangangailangan. Mayroon ding ganap na elastik, ganap na di-elastik, at unitary elastic na nagpapakita ng iba’t ibang antas ng pagtugon sa presyo. Mahalaga ito sa ekonomiya upang maunawaan ng mga negosyante at pamahalaan kung paano gumagalaw ang pamilihan.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong> Natutunan ko na ang elastisidad ay hindi lang tungkol sa presyo kundi sa ugali at pangangailangan ng tao. Sa tunay na buhay, may mga bagay tayong handang bilhin kahit mataas ang presyo, at may mga bagay na agad nating tinitigilan kapag mahal.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- LESSON 4 -->
    <div class="ap-card" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">
      <div class="ap-images">
        <img src="equilibrium1.png" alt="Lesson 4 Image 1">
        <img src="equilibrium2.png" alt="Lesson 4 Image 2">
      </div>
      <div class="ap-expand">
        <p><strong>Short Discussion:</strong> Ang market equilibrium ay ang punto kung saan ang quantity demanded ay katumbas ng quantity supplied, dito nagkakasundo ang mamimili at prodyuser sa presyo at dami ng produkto. Sa puntong ito, walang sobra (surplus) o kakulangan (shortage). Kapag lumayo sa equilibrium na mas maraming supply kaysa sa demand, may sobrang produkto at bumababa ang presyo, kapag mas maraming demand kaysa supply, may kakulangan at tumataas ang presyo. Ito ang balanse ng pamilihan.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong> Sa araling ito, naunawaan ko na ang ekwilibriyo ng pamilihan ay tungkol sa balanse ng gusto ng tao at kaya ng gumawa. Napagtanto ko na sa buhay, hindi rin natin matatamo ang tamang resulta kung sobra o kulang ang ginagawa natin parang sa pamilihan lang./p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- LESSON 5 -->
    <div class="ap-card" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">
      <h4>Lesson 5: Estruktura ng Pamilihan</h4>
      <div class="ap-images">
        <img src="structure1.jpg" alt="Lesson 5 Image 1">
        <img src="structure2.jpg" alt="Lesson 5 Image 2">
      </div>
      <div class="ap-expand">
        <p><strong>Short Discussion:</strong> Ang estruktura ng pamilihan ay tumutukoy sa uri ng kompetisyon at organisasyon ng pamilihan maaari itong perfect competition (ganap na kompetisyon), monopoly (monopolyo), monopsonyo, oligopoly (oligopolyo), o monopolistic competition (monopolistikong kompetisyon). Tinatalakay nito kung paano naapektuhan ng bilang ng prodyuser, uri ng produkto, at hadlang sa pagpasok sa merkado ang relasyon ng presyo at dami.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong> Dito ko nakitang hindi lahat ng produkto ay patas ang laban. Natuto akong maging mapanuri sa mga brand at tanungin kung bakit ganoon ang presyo at kalidad. Mahalaga ito sa pagsulong ng negosyo at pagiging patas ng merkado.</p>

        <p><strong>Short Discussion:</strong> Ang pamahalaan ay may tungkuling pangasiwaan ang pamilihan upang mapanatili ang kaayusan at protektahan ang mamimili at prodyuser. Sa pamamagitan ng mga patakarang tulad ng price ceiling, price floor, buwis, subsidiya, at regulasyon ng kompetisyon, naiiwasan ang pananamantala at kawalang-katarungan sa kalakalan. Ginagawa ito ng pamahalaan upang masiguro ang balanseng ekonomiya at kapakinabangan ng lahat.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong> Nauunawaan kong ang pamahalaan ay parang tagapamagitan sa pagitan ng mamimili at prodyuser. Kung wala ito, posibleng maging magulo at hindi patas ang pamilihan. Mahalaga ang mga patakarang ito upang mapanatili ang disiplina sa ekonomiya.</p>
